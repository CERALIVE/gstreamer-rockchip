# Fix audit

## F27 row schema

Every fix row appended by later todos must contain exactly these five fields:

1. **Provenance SHA** — the full source/fix commit SHA.
2. **Red/green outputs** — commands and captured failing-at-parent/passing-at-fix output.
3. **Hardware gate** — `hardware-independent`, or `hardware-gated` plus the board drill id.
4. **MPP ABI closure** — the before/after `nm` closure diff for MPP symbols.
5. **Reviewer verdict** — one of `confirmed`, `false-positive`, `needs-fix`, or `needs-human-review`.

## Mock-MPP verdict: WORKING

The host-only seam builds `tests/mock_mpp.c` as `libmppmock.so` against the same
`rockchip_mpp` headers selected by Meson, then preloads it while loading the built
plugin. It covers:

- `mpp_create`, `mpp_init`, and the encoder `MppApi` control/encode entry points;
- the `mpp_enc_cfg_set_*` and `mpp_enc_cfg_get_*` families with an in-memory key/value recorder;
- minimal buffer-group, DMA-fd, frame-association, packet, and metadata behavior needed to
  negotiate and submit one NV12 frame without `/dev/mpp_service`;
- process-local logs selected by `MPP_MOCK_LOG`, with the two Meson tests serialized.

`tests/mpp_gstharness.c` loads the real built factories and proves both `mpph264enc`
and `mpph265enc` negotiate and submit a 320x240 NV12 frame. For each codec it asserts
`prep:width=320`, `prep:height=240`, `rc:mode=1`, `rc:bps_target=500`,
`rc:fps_in_num=30`, `rc:fps_in_denorm=1`, `MPP_ENC_SET_CFG`,
`MPP_ENC_SET_SEI_CFG`, and `MPP_ENC_SET_HEADER_MODE`. The public `bitrate` property is
measured in BPS, so `500` is intentionally recorded without scaling.

The same executable introspects properties on `mppvideodec` and `mppjpegdec`, checks
the multicodec decoder's H.264/H.265/AV1 input and NV12 output template truth, and uses
GstHarness to assert the JPEG decoder advertises non-fixed NV12 raw output caps. These
checks create elements and inspect templates only; they submit no decoder input and
perform no MPP hardware access.

### Verification

With `rockchip_mpp.pc` available to pkg-config:

```sh
meson setup build -Drockchipmpp=enabled -Drga=disabled -Drkximage=disabled -Dkmssrc=disabled
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

Both tests must report `OK` in both runs. The registration test's negative control sets
`GST_PLUGIN_PATH` to a nonexistent directory and runs `gst-inspect-1.0 mppjpegdec`; it
must exit nonzero with `No such element or plugin`, proving plugin-load failures cannot
produce a false green. Detailed native output is retained by Meson in
`build/meson-logs/testlog.txt`; CI runs the same commands on bookworm and trixie.
